The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is the process followed to develop a program. For this Python program, the stages are:

1.
REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS: This is were we decide that the program should store “Hello World” in a

variable P,

use a formatted string, and display it along with another word. 

2
SYSTEM DESIGN: The system design is where we plan how to do it we choose Python, decide on the variables, and plan to use an 

f-string with print() 

for output. 

3.
IMPLEMENTATION: Implementation is about writing the code, assign values to the variables, and print the message.

4.
TESTING: is done to make sure the program runs correctly and the output is as expected. Once it works, we move to the next stage

5.
DEPLOYMENT: Saving the file and making it ready to run anywhere with Python. Finally,

6.
MAINTENANCE: ensures the program can be updated later, like changing the message or adding features, so it remains useful.
